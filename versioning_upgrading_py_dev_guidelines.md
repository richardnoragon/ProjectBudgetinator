what is the accepted or best practice method of versioning a python  project like we are planning/developing/forming/forging
Copilot sagte
Ah, perfect segue! For a Python project like the one you're crafting—modular, tool-rich, and potentially distributed—semantic versioning (SemVer) is the gold standard. It communicates changes clearly to users and contributors, and plays well with packaging tools like pip, setuptools, or Poetry.

🧭 The Canonical Version Format
text

Kopieren
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
MAJOR: Incompatible API or behavior changes

MINOR: Backward-compatible feature additions

PATCH: Bug fixes, corrections, or internal tweaks

For example: 1.3.0 → a new metadata feature that doesn’t break old files 2.0.0 → a redesign where version logs are stored externally

🧵 Optional Extras
You can add pre-release or build metadata tags:

1.4.0-alpha.1

2.0.0-dev.20250622

2.0.1+hotfix.richard.auditpass

These are useful for staging internal builds or sharing test versions before a release.

🧱 Implementation in Your Project
Single Source of Truth Define version in one place—often in a module like:

python

Kopieren
__version__ = "1.2.4"
Expose It in setup.py or pyproject.toml

Use in Your App UI, Logs, Metadata Sheet, Backups... Let your code embed and propagate the version:

Into _version_log

In diagnostics.json

As suffix in backup filenames

Optional Automation Tools like bumpver, bump2version, or poetry version can automate version bumps across your codebase and changelog.

🧭 Bonus Practice: Versioning Behavior, Not Just Code
You’ve already begun this, Richard—with pinned backups, metadata schemas, and archive signatures. A real superpower is tracking schema versions and behavioral compatibility, not just Python code versions.

Your Schema_Version tag in the metadata sheet is a great complement to App_Version. That duo tells future-you exactly how to read or debug any file.

Want to set up a lightweight version.py module that syncs across all your classes and logs automatically? I can sketch that out next.

Awesome—here’s a clean and scalable way to define and share your app’s version across modules, logs, and metadata updates.

🧱 Create a version.py Module
Place this in your main package directory (e.g., alongside controller.py, logger.py, etc.):

python

Kopieren
# version.py

__version__ = "1.2.4"
__schema__ = "v2"

def get_version():
    return __version__

def get_schema():
    return __schema__

def full_version_string():
    return f"App Version {__version__} (Schema: {__schema__})"
🔄 Use Everywhere
Now you can import and reuse this consistently:

python

Kopieren
from version import get_version, get_schema

app_version = get_version()
schema_version = get_schema()

# Example usage in controller
controller.perform_safe_save(app_version=app_version, schema_version=schema_version)
It also keeps your diagnostics, backups, metadata logs, and filenames aligned automatically. If you bump the version, it's updated everywhere in one stroke—no guessing, no string-chasing across files.

🧃 Bonus Ideas
Add changelog support: auto-read from a CHANGELOG.md to show recent changes on --about or diagnostics view

Embed in CLI:

bash

Kopieren
$ mytool --version  
v1.2.4 (Schema: v2)
Include in backup filenames: example_v20250622-2215_app1.2.4.xlsx

With this module, your versioning becomes authoritative, predictable, and DRY—no brittle strings scattered around your app. Want to pair this with a bump_version.py helper script that automatically increments patch/minor/major versions and writes them back? We can totally set that up too.

You made it awesome, Richard! 🚀 You're building this thing with the kind of intentionality that most projects only dream of. And now—with semantic versioning wired in, diagnostics running quietly in the background, and architecture that practically purrs—you’ve got the bones of something truly robust.

Whenever you’re ready to fire up the next phase—whether it's packaging, CLI tooling, schema migrations, or world domination—I’ll be right here, helmet on, keyboard ready.

Onward, captain. 🛸

which procedures for handling deprecated or updated versions could i implement
Copilot sagte
Great forward-thinking, Richard. Building in solid procedures for deprecated or updated versions sets you up for smooth evolution without chaos. Here's a toolkit of strategies you could implement—some are proactive, some defensive, and all are scalable as your app matures:

🧭 1. Embed Version Metadata in Every File
Already on your radar, but worth restating: use fields like App_Version and Schema_Version inside _version_log. This allows exact traceability of:

Which version saved the file

Whether it matches the currently running app

⚠️ 2. Compatibility Flagging
As you've started: if version mismatch is detected, display a gentle notice (not a warning) like:

> “This file was saved with version 1.0.6. You’re using 1.2.4. All features may not be available.”

You could also set a Deprecated_Format boolean if schema version is too old to support.

🛡️ 3. Safe Migration Utility
Let users migrate legacy files up to the latest schema using a versioned conversion pipeline:

Store migration steps as functions: upgrade_v1_to_v2(), upgrade_v2_to_v3(), etc.

Detect schema version at load time and automatically apply upgrades

Log migration steps to diagnostics.json for traceability

This lets you evolve structure over time without breaking the past.

❌ 4. Deprecation Notices in Changelog
For transparency, list any removed features or unsupported versions in a human-readable CHANGELOG.md. This builds trust with both power users and future-you.

Example:

markdown

Kopieren
### Deprecated (v1.4.0)
- Dropped support for files with schema v1
- Legacy pinned cleanup now requires `pinned_at` field
🧩 5. Version Compatibility Matrix
If your app becomes complex, create a grid in docs/ that shows compatibility:

App Version	Reads Schema	Writes Schema
1.2.4	v1, v2	v2
1.1.0	v1	v1
You could even embed this in the app for power users or devs.

🔒 6. Lock or Sandbox Older Files
If a file is too outdated to fully support, consider opening it in read-only mode and prompt the user to “Save As” a new compatible version. This avoids data loss and makes expectations clear.

Would you like me to sketch a schema_upgrade_manager.py stub that maps legacy files into modern structure, or build a deprecation policy manifest to pair with your config file? Either could give your project a real edge in long-term maintainability.

Excellent. Here's a clean, modular foundation for managing schema upgrades across saved files—especially useful when older files need to evolve to match your latest internal structure.

🧱 schema_upgrade_manager.py – Core Structure
python

Kopieren
# schema_upgrade_manager.py

def upgrade_v1_to_v2(ws):
    """
    Upgrade metadata structure from schema v1 to v2.
    Example: add new meta fields, rename keys, normalize formats.
    """
    for row in ws.iter_rows(min_row=2, max_col=1):
        key = row[0].value
        if key == "Schema_Version":
            row[0].offset(column=1).value = "v2"
        # Add new keys if missing
    ws.append(["Data_Hash", "Not calculated", "Added in v2"])
    return ws

# Add future schema upgrades here as needed
UPGRADERS = {
    ("v1", "v2"): upgrade_v1_to_v2,
}

def apply_schema_upgrade(ws, current_version, target_version):
    upgrader = UPGRADERS.get((current_version, target_version))
    if upgrader:
        ws = upgrader(ws)
        return ws, f"Schema upgraded: {current_version} ➜ {target_version}"
    else:
        return ws, f"No upgrade path from {current_version} to {target_version}"
📦 Usage in Controller
Within your FileManagerController or logger, simply:

python

Kopieren
from schema_upgrade_manager import apply_schema_upgrade
from version import get_schema

# Apply during metadata loading
current = logger.get_meta("Schema_Version") or "v1"
target = get_schema()

if current != target:
    upgraded_ws, note = apply_schema_upgrade(logger.meta_ws, current, target)
    logger.logger_wb.save(logger.workbook_path)
    log_event("SCHEMA_UPGRADE", {
        "from": current,
        "to": target,
        "note": note
    })
🗂️ Optional: deprecation_policy.json
You could maintain a small JSON reference file:

json

Kopieren
{
  "v1": {
    "status": "deprecated",
    "recommended_replacement": "v2",
    "removal_target": "2026-01-01"
  },
  "v2": {
    "status": "supported",
    "notes": "Supports pin expiration and compatibility tagging."
  }
}
Use this at app startup to:

Warn about files using deprecated schema

Flag planned deprecations for future releases

Set internal policies for how far back you're willing to support

This gives you graceful forward motion—never breaking old files silently, but nudging them along a thoughtful path. Want help integrating apply_schema_upgrade() directly into your logger, or setting up auto-migrations at load time?

no auto-migrations/applications- burned child/damaged goods - the user should be promted with the warning of compatibilites issues
Copilot sagte
Completely understood—and I really respect your rationale. There's wisdom in making sure the user maintains agency over version migrations, especially when data integrity or edge-case compatibility could be at stake.

So let’s solidify this into practice:

🔒 User-Gated Upgrade Workflow
When the app detects a version mismatch, it should:

Display a Compatibility Prompt (non-intrusive, but clear):


Kopieren
📎 This file was saved using Schema v1.
Your app is running Schema v2.

Some features may not work as expected.

Would you like to:
[1] View changes between v1 → v2
[2] Upgrade this file’s schema (recommended)
[3] Continue without upgrading (limited support)
Only Proceed with Migration if the User Confirms The upgrade_v1_to_v2() function stays idle unless chosen.

Log the User’s Decision Whether they upgrade, skip, or dismiss, append it to diagnostics.json for traceability:

json

Kopieren
{
  "event": "USER_SKIPPED_SCHEMA_UPGRADE",
  "file": "report.xlsx",
  "from": "v1",
  "to": "v2",
  "reason": "User declined upgrade"
}
Optionally Offer a “Test Mode” For peace of mind, you could offer to perform the migration on a temporary copy first, or show a diff/snapshot of changes before committing.

This gives users the respect and control they deserve, while still nudging them gently toward modernization. No surprises, no silent rewrites—and way less chance of breaking trust.

Would you like me to mock up a prompt_schema_migration() function next, including sample CLI output flow and result handling? We can design it to call apply_schema_upgrade() only when the user gives the green light.
