    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize performance monitoring
        self.performance_monitor = get_performance_monitor()
        
        # Add performance indicator to status bar
        self._setup_performance_indicator()
        
        # Add performance monitor to Help menu
        help_menu.add_command(label="Performance Monitor", 
                             command=self.show_performance_monitor)
```

## üíª Usage Examples

### Basic Monitoring
```python
from utils.performance_monitor import monitor_performance

@monitor_performance()

```python
from utils.performance_monitor import monitor_file_operation

def save_workbook(file_path, data):
    with monitor_file_operation('write', file_path):
        # File operation is automatically tracked
        save_data_to_file(file_path, data)
```

### Performance Report Generation
```python
from utils.performance_monitor import create_performance_report

# Generate comprehensive performance report
report_file = create_performance_report()
print(f"Report saved to: {report_file}")
```
