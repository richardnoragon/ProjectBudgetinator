- **Session Management**: Application session tracking (`session_id`)
- **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in timing and resource metrics
- **Business Context**: Custom business metrics and KPI tracking
- **Log Aggregation Ready**: JSON format for ELK stack, Splunk, etc.

**Integration Status**:
- ✅ `src/main.py` - Application initialization and operation context
- ✅ `src/utils/error_handler.py` - Error tracking with structured logging
- ✅ `src/handlers/add_partner_handler.py` - Handler-specific structured logging
- ✅ Context propagation across all operations
- ✅ JSON log files for machine processing
- ✅ Traditional console output for human readability

**Verification Results**:
```
✅ Demo Script: examples/structured_logging_demo.py - All features working
✅ Application Launch: Structured logging active in main application
✅ Log Files: JSON formatted logs in ~/ProjectBudgetinator/Log Files/
✅ Context Tracking: Operation IDs, user context, and session tracking functional
✅ Performance Metrics: Timing and resource tracking operational
```

**Benefits Achieved**:
- Complete operation visibility with correlation tracking
- User action auditing and context tracking
- Performance monitoring and business intelligence
- Log aggregation ready with JSON formatting
- Enhanced debugging capabilities with automatic context
- Thread-safe logging in multi-threaded environments
